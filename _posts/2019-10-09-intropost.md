<h2>My First Post</h2>
<br>
  
I have been interested in creating a portfolio for some time. In a very competitive job market, especially as an analyst, I feel that a portfolio can help set someone apart. 
There were several options I was looking into in starting this blog/portfolio, but I settled on using Github pages and Jekyll for several reasons, mainly because it is free.
I will post some links that helped me get started below.
<br>

The goal I hope to to achieve in starting this blog/portfolio is to post insightful content that makes people think analytical, just like it does for me. 
My undergraduate degree was in Economics, so naturally I tend to think analytically. However, analytics helps drive everyday life and should be made more aware publicly. 
Additionally, a smaller goal I have is to post weekly, whether it be a blog post on an analytical/economic topic or a analytical project that I worked on. I have several miscellaneous projects in the works
consistently, but unfortunately, I am not so great on finishing them in chronological order. I tend to start many projects at any given time, and most go unfinished. I hope to be better at that in doing this blog/portfolio. 
Before I post anything, I will clean up my various code as any coder/programmer can relate to having messy code.  
<br>


Initially, I will be working on some older projects from a spreadsheet modeling class from undergrad and clean up the formulas, appearance, and other features to make them presentable for this portfolio. Then I will upgrade said projects, and some of them can 
utilize VBA and some automated process that I had no knowledge of when taking the class. Also, other items on my project list are some easy guided projects from various sites, including analyticsvidhya.com, to help ease me into a rhythm of doing projects consistently while also mastering certain skills along the way. 
<br>

Later down the road, I will also be tackling my own personal projects of my own personal interests. These projects will vary, and I will be utilizing various tools and software common in the data science and data analytics community to complete these projects, including Excel, Access, Tableau, SSMS, Python, and R to name a few.  
Something I also hope to post frequently are Makeover Mondayâ€™s from https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/. Makeover Monday is a weekly visualization challenge where a dataset is posted, and your goal is to visualize the dataset as best as you can. Tableau users know that Tableau can be used to both discover insights from data and present these findings in an artistic way. I will admit that I am not very artistic, so these projects will likely be presented in a standard format.

Below is the main video I used to set up this jekyll site:

It's simple video to use and gets the basics set up for starting a site. However, it is about a year old so there were some changes that needed to be made. It is also a very simple video, 
and jekyll has a lot to offer. Below are some other sites/videos that I used to further develop this website:
