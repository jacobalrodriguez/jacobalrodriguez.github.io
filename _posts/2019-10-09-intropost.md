<h2>My First Post!</h2>
<br>
  
I have been interested in creating a portfolio for sometime. In a very competeitve job market, especially as an analyst, I feel that a portfolio can help set someone apart. 
There were several options I was looking into in starting this blog/portflio, but I settled on using Github pages and jekyll for several reasons, mainly because it is free.
I will post some links that helped me get started below.
<br>

The goal I hope to to achieve in starting this blog/portflio is to post insightful content that makes people think analytical, just like it does for me. 
My undergraduate degree was in Economics, so naturally I tend to think analytically. However, analytics helps drive everyday life and should be made more aware publicly. 
Additionally, a smaller goal I have is to post weekly, whether it be a blog post on an analytical/economic topic or a analytical project that I worked on. I have several misc projects in the works
conssitetly, but unfortuenately I am not so great on finishing one at a time. I tend to start many projects at any given time and most go unfinished. I hope to be better at that in doing this blog/portfolio. 
Before I post anything, I will clean up my various code as any coder/programmer can relate to having messy code.

Below is the main video I used to set up this jekyll site:
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M</a>

It's simple video to use and gets the basics set up for starting a site. However, it is about a year old so there were some changes that needed to be made. It is also a very simple video, 
and jekyll has a lot to offer. Below are some other sites/videos that I used to further develop this website:
