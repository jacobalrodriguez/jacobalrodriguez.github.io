I'm a junior data analyst in the greater southern California area. Over the course of my academic and professional career,
I have obtained a wide range of skills that allows me to be versatile in any data related profession. These skills
include data pre-processing, data manipulation, data visualization, and data modeling. 

My undergraduate degree is a B.S. in Economics with a concentration in Supply Chain Management. I hope to enroll
in a masters program in the near future and obtain an M.S. in Applied Analytics or Business Analytics.
