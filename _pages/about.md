Hi! Thank you for viewing my data analytics/data science portfolio. My name is Jacob Rodriguez, I am an aspiring data 
analyst/data scientist with a deep passion for all things data. My professional and educational careers have led me to 
experience many data-related professions, exposing me to data analysis, data visualization, process automation, ETL methods,
database management, and so much more at such an early stage in my career. 

I am currently obtaining my M.S. in Analytics from the Georgia Institute of Technology, with hopes of one day earning my Ph.D. in Economics.
There are many incomplete projects that I hope to soon post on this portfolio, but the main goal of tihis is to promote analytical thinking
and hopefully provide some useful methods and ideas for other analysts who are interested.
